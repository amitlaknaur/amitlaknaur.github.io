						<h2>my Product Management affinity</h2>
						<h3>Motto: Sell the experience, Bill the goods. </h3>
                        
                        <p>After successfully developing test, measurement, validation and automation tools with higher than intended adoption in my forte of electrical engineering I realized to have unknowingly developed the mindset for Product Development and importantly the zeal for product management. In these exercises, I have dealt and executed for best End-User experience, usability, affordance,  and handled the associated cost, scalability, development backlogs, epics, and stories. </p>
                            
                         <p> The biggest strengths I bring are critical thinking and creative thinking in the multidimensional journey that is of product development. It comes naturally and I apply it sub-consciously even in everyday routines. For example, we recently purchased a particular swing-chair of the shortlisted two, where-in the rejected one had a semicircular base for stability but matched the exact floor color which would be a tripping hazard. When I say this aloud in the store I think of analogous issues on the products I am/will-be handling. </p>
                        
                        <p> Using some stories mine and otherwise, let me draw a picture of how I connect to the product management/ownership arena. For example please look at the pictures below tell me which one is appealing the most. At a high level, they are all sunsets. The trees bring in the dimension depth and, anchor our perspective. The image pops up when the rule of thirds is used in framing the foreground to background ratio. We apply this ratio vertically too to place the trees within the right third of the frame. Just the way there is the science focus, lighting, and composition that goes into clicking a good picture, enough science and tools go into owning a product and molding it. These can only go so far, from there we need to engage with indirect tools from market analysis, competition research, User research, pricing, promotion, user demography and more to facilitate launching a product and reap success. </p>

											<h3>Simple, intuitive User experience</h3>
											<span> I have learnt from experience that the user experience needs to be simple and non-cumbersome in flow. What doesn't flow will 'drop' and will become an ideal corner to be caught in a good funnel analysis. In the past when I designed a measurement tool with a clean intuitive web application based results view, it got deployed into other departments with a little tailoring. 1000s of smartphone Apps fail to capture the market as they fail to keep the user engaged either by glitchy or complicated interface/experience. The elevator pitch equivalent in the digital world has only a few seconds of a potential user's attention.   </span>
                                             <span> Another great example for me is Netflix's seamless streaming where it adjusts to the device, the screen size, internet speeds among other parameters. Good content might draw new customers but streaming hiccups will lead to abandoned accounts.   </span>
										</li>
										<li>
											<span class="fa fa-star"></span>
											<h3>Market research</h3>
											<span>When we make a product and are successful in the market, to keep better-ing it becomes imperative so the market share does not get divided or worse your share is lost. Let's say there is a beautiful product and everyone in the business uses it (think excel or similar). If one creates a browser version of it (let's say google's sheets). Now not only are they tapping into the huge user base who are pre-trained to use the product its the new 'go-to' now because it is portable, sharable, live-edit-track, OS/browser agnostic. The original product still has its strengths but everywhere else it has become a choice. </span>
										</li>
                                        <li>
											<span class="fa fa-star"></span>
											<h3>Product Roadmap</h3>
											<span>The primary reason one should build the product roadmap is to make sure all the stakeholders are aligned. Aligned w.r.t feature prioritization, major milestones and MVP-ETAs as these help them (Marketing, Sales, Engineering, finance, E-staff and Customer when applicable) plan their resources and be prepared. As we all know roadmaps sometimes become timetables but without one you might as well call your goal a hobby. 
                                            Product roadmaps are required to be best representation of the product strategy and goal timelines, this also means that they are dynamic in nature. Dynamic because we keep asking "what has changed and what is the impact?" question constantly, and they include Cutomer-needs, Competition-news and business-decisions to name a few.</span>

											<h3>Don't re-invent the wheel</h3>
											<span>A dramatic example would be that if a new car model is released with interchangeable Brake and Gas pedals (you are trying to address over usage of the right leg/ankle/foot when driving). Even if the DOT approved it customers will be too few and you too far from breaking even. A moderate example would be when creating a new text editor from scratch (like notepad++), try to organize all the new features into existing groupings/tags (File, Edit, View, Help, etc; and keep all the short-cut combinations applicable even if you plan to build a special keyboard for it. Always bank on the familiarity and build upon it. Yes, exceptions are plenty; like being able to zoom or pan on a webpage or map (using a multi-sense mouse/track-pad) without having to click a bunch of times.  </span>
										</li>
										<li>
											<span class="fa fa-star"></span>
											<h3>Major overhaul? Don't make the user brace for it</h3>
											<span>When it comes to overhauling an existing feature/product, respect the aprehensions, tap into the loyalty, deliver the exquisite experience. Let's say you are launching a newer view for an email service to support chat/phone service within. Lower the apprehensions of the non-savvy or the not-ready (lets say a new browser, security etc and IT finds it expensive) by letting the user try a lighter version without necessitating the IT efforts or a seamless switchback option. </span>
										</li>
                                        <li>
											<span class="fa fa-star"></span>
											<h3>Control | Variations</h3>
											<span>A|B testing with multiple knobs for feedback is one of the simple tools at a PMs disposal. Let's say you are hosting cloud-based online gaming. The new graphics are more lifelike but add some delay based on the where the online user is. You can release the new graphics to a segment of users. Or use other metrics as Mac/Windows, ISP-provider as other partitionings to learn a more multi-variate effect on the user experience.  
                                                The below mockup created in Balsamiq shows an example of A|B testing use case. Here we are seeing a mock-up of an online bidding service (like ebay). We also see 'similar items' and 'people also bought' under an item an user is looking at. Now the candidacy for the testing can include:
                                        
                                            </span>
										</li>
                                        
									</ul>
                                    <ol type="1">
                                        <li>1. Order of the 'similar items' and 'people also bought' which could help us learn if the user is distracted or is making a learned bid. And if the user is buying more items which is motorcycle accesories in this example. We do not want to make the page more complicated than needed. </li>
                                        <li>2. What value of either of the lists add? Are these getting any clicks, turning into ad-revenue or purchases.</li>
                                        <li>3. Whether to include current bid value for each of the items in these lists.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <span>
                                    </span>
